Two-Dimensional-Array
=====================

A simple 2D Array written in Objective-C. You can include the source files directly or use CocoaPods to bring this into your project.

Initialization is easy:

TJMTwoDimensionalArray *array = [[TJMTwoDimensionalArray alloc] initWithNumberOfRows:4 numberOfColumns:4];

The header file outlines the available methods for adding/removing elements, clearing the array, and getting the locationof an object in the array.
